Welcome to our new Developer Blog!

Moving our Blog to GitHub is the last step of our project restructuring.
Blogger is good platform, but posting C++ snippets is not very convenient.
Neither is managing the Blog from multiple accounts. Posting code snippets
using Jekyll Markup and having the user management from GitHub makes blogging
much easier going forward for the whole team.

We hope you like the new layout and our new address
<http://blog.actor-framework.org>.
